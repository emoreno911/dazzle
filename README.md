# DAZZLE PROTOCOL
Dazzle is a dApp that allows you to send tokens and NFT’s to anyone through a simple link, so you can onboard your friends into DeFi just by sending them a link via email or your favorite messaging app.

With the Smartwallet feature users can get a wallet who is linked to a social account like Google, Facebook, Github, Twitter, etc. That's the only they need to send tokens, they can receive tokens in the Smartwallet too. At the moment only the Google authentication provider is enabled and is working with the Tron blockchain integration.

## How we built it
Dazzle’s architecture is made up of three parts: the Smart Contracts for Dazzle Protocol and the Smartwallets which are made in Solidity and deployed over the Hedera network and Tron blockchain, the backend where we have an API with ExpressJS and the frontend made with ReactJS. For the interaction with the user’s wallet, Hashpack is used for the Hedera Network and TronLink is selected for Tron.

## What's next?
We're working in our first multichain deployment over the TRON Blockchain.
