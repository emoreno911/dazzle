# DAZZLE
A dApp that allows you to send tokens and NFT's to anyone through a simple LINK.

Demo: https://testnet.dazzleprotocol.com/

## How we built it
Dazzle’s architecture is made up of three parts: the Smart Contracts for Dazzle Protocol and the Smartwallets which are made in Solidity and deployed over the Hedera network and Tron blockchain, the backend where we have an API with ExpressJS and the frontend made with ReactJS. For the interaction with the user’s wallet, Hashpack is used for the Hedera Network and TronLink is selected for Tron.

## What's next?
We're working in our first multichain deployment over the TRON Blockchain.
